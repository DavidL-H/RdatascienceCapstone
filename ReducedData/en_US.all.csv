Even more troubling is the tripling of the cost to our trucking companies. Did the Missouri Department of Transportation take into consideration the amount of students who travel back and forth to the several universities on the I-70 corridor between St. Louis and Kansas City? As the parent of a student at the University of Missouri in Columbia, I know my child does not have the means to pay $30.00 every time he makes a 200 mile round trip from our home in St. Charles to the university. Did the Transportation Dept. take into consideration the cost to the small towns along this route who will ultimately suffer if this toll road comes to fruition? Motorists will not be able to afford the extra cost of visiting these small communities that depend on consumers for their livelihood. Towns, such as Hermann and Fulton, who depend on the tourism trade will be adversely affected. The overall cost to these communities, as well as the state itself, will be enormous. Motorists from our state, as well as others, might decide the cost of the toll roads far outweigh the desire to visit our state for the many amenities we provide. The Lake of the Ozarks and all of the towns along the way will lose many tourists to other recreational sites in other states.

It took me several moments to figure out that this was the playing-out of the fleeting reference we'd seen earlier in the episode, as Roger's LSD storyline was beginning. Anyway, Don once again bullies past Megan's protestations -- she feels bad ditching Peggy and the rest of the Heinz team -- and insists she accompany him on the trip to Howard Johnson's. She complies, but is clearly not happy. As Don, in his own world of domestic bliss, tells her she must try the orange sherbet, she objects to his smoking in the car. And things go downhill from there. At the blandly cheery HoJo's, Don keeps wanting things his way, until Megan finally blows up. ""Maybe you could make up a schedule for me so I'll know when I'm working, and when I'm the wife,"" she says. The fight continues to the parking lot, with Megan saying, ""Get in the car, eat ice cream, leave work, take off your dress. Yes, master!"" So much for the newlywed glow Roger had so envied. Instead of talking it out, Don gets in the car, and drives off, leaving Megan in the parking lot. Once he cools off and returns, she's gone. He waits, getting more frazzled by the moment, at HoJo's, but there's no sign of Megan. Finally, seven hours later, he heads home, and finds Megan there. They fight again, her yelling at him for leaving her there, him saying he thought she was dead. She tries to run away, but he follows her, and they both tumble onto the carpet. But the mood is very different from the beginning of the season, when we saw them in this same position after having had sex.","en_US.news",1071

"9177","Format: There is only one way to top an album with a seventeen-minute centerpiece, and that’s to release two and a quarter hours of music, all at once, spread over three disks. “Have One On Me” is a mini boxed-set: open up the case, and you’ll find a lyric booklet, and sleeves marked one, two, and three. Each is decorated with a cute photo of Joanna Newsom in a short dress and pointy shoes, putting up her hair; she is not above fanservice. Ever meticulous, Newsom has divided the collection evenly: six songs per disc. In a concession to the iPod age, some of the advance hype suggested that “Have One On Me” was really three separate albums released all at once, and you weren’t expected to sit there and listen to the artist scraping her harp for one hundred and thirty minutes straight, not really -- I mean, it’s a fast-paced world, and there are season premieres to catch that can’t be Tivoed. If you jump around, an out-for-vengeance Joanna Newsom isn’t going to burst through your front door with a flaming sword, but it is pretty clear to this first time caller and long-time listener that she means for you to experience “Have One On Me” as a complete statement. She’s an album artist; she never would have ended a set with a track that begs for the kind of resolution that “Occident” -- the HOOM disc 2 closer -- does. Consider also that ideas developed in the very first song on HOOM1 are brought to a satisfying conclusion on the last song of HOOM3, and that that last song on HOOM3 is a reprise of the epic track in the middle of HOOM2. (And yes, I do enjoy referring to this massive, sometimes-overwhelming set as HOOM; it sounds like a supercomputer crossed with a loom crossed with a vacuum cleaner, which, come to think of it, isn’t a halfway-bad description of Newsom’s brain.) If you made it through “69 Love Songs” or, for you Jersey emo types, “The Mother, The Mechanic, And The Path,” “Have One On Me” ought to be no sweat. I do recognize that attention spans are shortening by the hour, and that those who would once have gladly listened to “Tales From Topographic Oceans” in a trance are now busy channel-surfing and text-messaging and voting for the latest American Idol. You might conclude that anybody who’d actually bother to absorb “Have One On Me” in one sitting is either 1.) a technophobe who cannot get with the earth-shattering, synapse-scrambling, aphasia-precipitating possibilities of the new technologies, 2.) some kind of crazy, or 3.) hopelessly in love with Joanna Newsom. I could be any one of those things, or several of them; I’ll let you decide at the end of the review. But even if I am, that does not preclude the possibility that the full megadose of HOOM is good tonic for your soul. If it is, I mean; I haven’t begun to render judgment here. An epic album deserves an epic write-up, and if the artist can go long, this cagy interlocutor can, too.","en_US.news",4177

When I am sweeping the floor, and I have to stop a little monarch from dragging his cloak through the accumulated dust 15 times, it's annoying. When I have to pick soggy Cheerios off the blanket after breakfast, it's off-putting. And when I have to buckle a car seat around the blanket, it's too much.

"10082","West Elm had sent me $25 design dollars I had to use by April 15. I sent Chris with the card since he was going to be near a store. I told him just to get us some pretty bowls. Well then that day they emailed me a 15% off my purchase, including sale prices, because they wanted me back so badly. And every time they come back to me I just can't say no. So of course I emailed Chris and told him not to use the dollars, and immediately got online to choose something. I decided on the Hand Blocked Mosaic Quilt which was a more dramatic choice for me. I tend to go for plain bedding. I liked the inky blue and thought it would work well with my gold leafed nightstands. Anyhow, it arrived this past week and I put it on the bed and loved it. But I was afraid Chris would hate it! So I didn't tell him it arrived and just waited for him to see it. And when he got home from work and went upstairs to give Sawyer his shower, he saw it. He came downstairs and specifically told me ""I really love that new bedspread. I really love it"". I had to ask him if he was messing with me, but he wasn't. So win-win. We both love it!

All chopped up and going for a big multilayerd chorus again. These electronics in whatever way they're reassembled sounds completely contemporary, like a rewinding tape recorder in the late '90s. It's gigantically playing with DJ tools and dance culture in an experimental-pop way with a sped up thin acoustic. There isn't a single sound that hasn't been processed into oblivion for the sake of surprising fun. Playing with those clear precise points as much as the broad swaths of hiss, because Dan's not keeping it completely sterile. Like the next one, ""Gave Away and Broke"" where a hyper rhythm becomes a larger reference point, like a crazy experiment to take an impossible BPM and build anything useable around it.

I know that I may have ruffled some feathers concerning the fact that I am proud of the fact that I give my patterns away for free. It's not because I somehow feel like I'm better than someone else because I do. Everyone has their own personal reasons for doing what they do. What I find irritating, both as a free pattern user and a free pattern creator, is when someone puts the stipulation that this item is for your personal use only and that you cannot sell any product made from that pattern. Here's why I don't like that. With that stipulation you are telling people that they cannot recuperate any of the costs that it took them to make it. I am all for donating. I am all for giving gifts away. Believe me, that's how all of my patterns came about. But, for me to tell you that in your private life when someone wants to purchase an item that you have the ability to create and they don't; and they want to bless you by purchasing it from you instead of just expecting you to do all that work for nothing.....and you CAN'T?? To me, that is wrong. There should be intellectual rights for a pattern, you bet. No one should be able to claim a pattern that is not theirs. And no one should be able to take a pattern and mass produce an item to create an empire out of it. But, there is no harm in someone having the ability to work a craft fair or two. Or sell to a local boutique or two. If the designer asks you not to sell in a certain place, then by all means respect that, but to say that NOTHING you make from that pattern is saleable.....yeah, well, you know what I think.","en_US.blogs",103

Prior to this, the gas stations along the route were either closed or ‘unfriendly’ toward outsiders. We pushed it about 1.5 kilometers to the top of the pass, then coasted the next 15km down the winding, mountain road, and then rolled to a stop at the checkpoint.

She has never been before, so it will be a really special treat. We are also taking away the pacifier - Disneyland is supposed to be the consolation prize. Upon the suggestion of my dear friend (who is also the manager of a dental office) it was time to give up the paci, and the perfect story to go with it: The paci fairy is coming to take all the pacifiers from you to bring them to all the other little babies who dont have any at all. Venissa also got Aurora a soft Ariel doll for her birthday that she has really taken to and so we are hoping she can stand in to settle her when she is inconsolable. So when she goes to bed on Sunday night, we are going to help her get all her pacifiers together for the fairy then when she wakes up on Monday we go to Disneyland! Abby is teething (getting THREE top teeth all at once and they are coming in SLOWLY) so I hope she is not too fussy for our trip.

The Confiteor continued to develop in the enumeration of sins, the persons confessed to and the persons invoked for their prayers - in the latter two categories, the Blessed Virgin Mary and the patron saint were the most likely choices. A missal of Augsburg in the 16th century gives an elaborate form mentioning sins in thought, speech, consent, sight, mouth, deed and omission and invoking saints Peter, Paul, Ullric (Udalric) Sebastian, Vitus, Mary Magdalene, Catherine, Barbara, and the patrons in the second half of the Confiteor.","en_US.blogs",531

The Defense Department would surely be there, for national security reasons of course. CIA? Probably, since they use the Internet to catch criminals and since they have so much power now to spy on us thanks to bills like The Patriot Act. How about Homeland Security? The military, and all of its branches? Raytheon, and other weapons contractors would probably be there too. I wonder who would represent the Federal Government? How about the Federal Reserve (a non-government agency) and the IRS (the Federal Reserves non-governmental private police and collection force for the central banks)? Heck, even Bill Gates would be there, but he would probably only have about as much power as the President of the United States has over his corporation, which is thankfully still called America.

In fact one of the most famous essays on locked-room mysteries appears in this novel’s 17th chapter: “The Locked-Room Lecture.” The appeal of this type of mystery is the impossible nature of the crime. “The essence of the locked room formula,” claims Dove, “is paradox: the thing could not happen, but it has happened” (1986, 34).","en_US.blogs",808

Yesterday, I was in my studio, seated at my table working. Suddenly, I heard a metallic, musical sound. In turning around, I noticed a tall man, of a race that I didn’t know, a curious red bonnet on his head, who was standing in the room. I immediately realized that it was a psychical trouble. The man was holding in his hand a sort of tuning-fork composed of two branches, with which he had produced the sound of which I spoke. Between the two branches was a gilded hammer. Immediately, I saw appear on the ground piles of fat white insects which were tearing each other apart in a rustling of wings whose deafening noise was becoming intolerable. I still have this sound in my ears which is upsetting all my nerves. When the hallucination was over, I immediately started to draw the scene with a stick of seria. Then I went out to take some air. In passing before a newspaper kiosque, an impulse that I am unable to explain, given that I don’t like this magazine, prodded me to ask for Simplicissimus. As the salesgirl was giving me the last number, a decision just as inexplicable prodded me to say: ‘No, not this number, the one before, please!’ Back home, in flicking through the magazine, I found to my great stupefaction your story The Game of the Crickets relating, give or take a few details, all that I had just experienced myself one hour beforehand: the man with the red bonnet, the insects that were tearing each other apart, etc. I beg you, dear Sir, to have the kindness, if you can, to explain to me how I should interpret this thing…”","en_US.blogs",824

"10868","The focal point of the story is Jason Todd, and he is voiced by Jensen Ackles of The CW’s Supernatural. I feel Jensen does an admirable job here, but at times, the voice sounds a little too mature, too deep for the character’s age. Jason’s probably in his late teens, maybe early twenties. Jensen does lighten up his voice from what he uses in his signature role of Dean Winchester. However, he does portray the role here very well projecting Todd’s charisma, humor, intellect, aggression, hatred, and conviction in well rounded form. Jason started as a punk kid that Batman attempted to mold into a better person, but he never succeeded. What he evolves into is someone that has the same core ideal of Batman to combat crime and using much the same tactics, but with more extreme methods drawing the line of how much violence is enough farther out. He believes that Batman cannot ultimately succeed because he puts limits on himself. Jason is a character I have become very intrigued by as he walks that thin anti-hero line where he could be a hero or a villain at any given moment depending on circumstance and motive.","en_US.blogs",868

Raph is the demon sent to steal Abby's soul after making him fall in love with her he breaks up with her in a way so cruel I actually blushed with embarrassment and anger for her. Even though that happened before the book starts the authors do a wonderful job building it into the story line, and amazingly enough making the readers fall in love with the tortured demon. Gabriel is the perfect counter to Raph. He's there for Abby and brings her back from the edge. There's a lot going on in the plot so the romance doesn't get as much page times as other novels would take, but the authors somehow pull it off. The romance is subtle and real enough that I can fall in love right along with Abby.","en_US.blogs",913

"10920","Some will point to Israel’s inherent right to exist as a fulfillment of prophesy. Furthermore, they will contend that her establishment has been meticulously planned since the late 19th Century. Indeed, the Zionist dream of a Jewish Homeland advocated by Theodor Herzl and the consequent Balfour Declaration provided a sound template. Unfortunately, one key component of that template was neglected in implementation. Herzl insisted that Jewish State implementation called for harmonious acceptance and integration in the indigenous Palestinian population as a precondition to establishment. This did not happen. Nazi Germany’s treatment of Jews in the Holocaust caused unprecedented urgency, and accelerated the imposition of the Israeli State in a partitioned Palestine. Haste and a lack of local acceptance seemed timely and just to the Allied victors, i.e. a lesser evil. Also, the focus on great 20th Century fascist and socialist ideologies caused a marginalization of Palestinian (much less Islamic) discontent. Indeed, Zionists violently secured their interests against indigenous Palestinians and neighboring nations around 1948, both conventionally and unconventionally. In the end Herzl’s key precondition was far from met. It is even less so today, and the disenfranchised opponents may soon be nuclear armed.","en_US.blogs",920

"10926","This point can be better understood by considering the explosive repertoire of the PIRA. Technically proficient though it was, the PIRA was greatly enabled by the commercially produced Semtex (and presumably detonators, or primaries, as well) that it was provided with over the years by Gaddafi’s Libyan regime. Used in medium-sized bombs (such as the one used to blow up the Grand Hotel in Brighton in 1984), as booster charges for large car bombs, and in home-made, anti-personnel coffee jar bombs designed to detonate on impact, Semtex made a great impact on the PIRA’s military capabilities. A plastic explosive designed to combine the characteristics of explosive power, insensitivity to shock, and malleability, and possessing uniform and entirely predictable characteristics, Semtex is an ideal secondary explosive, and one of the most versatile explosive compositions in existence. The PIRA doubtless had the ability to produce secondary explosives itself, and would have done so when necessary. But this did not reduce the utility of its Semtex supplies. How much greater would the utility of such high-quality explosives be to inexperienced bomb-builders trying to cobble devices together in their bath-tubs?","en_US.blogs",926

"10941","2006’s Happy Feet wasn’t a great movie by any means, but for all its cute dancing penguins what lingers in the memory is what an eccentric vision Miller placed on screen, especially by family-movie standards. Unfortunately, genuine eccentricity in cinema is hard to pull off in a way that’s charming rather than annoyingly precious, and doubly so when a filmmaker must re-create his original formula. The biggest problem with Happy Feet is how what was once endearingly off-kilter now feels focus-grouped to death. Oh sure, all the hallmarks of the original- cute penguins singing and dancing along with popular songs, impressive computer animation, zany supporting characters- are there, but now it feels like Miller and company said, “hey, that was fun the first time, so why not double it up in the sequel?” So (to cite the most egregious example) instead of just getting Robin Williams to mince around in two roles- which, I mean, ugh- you’ve also got Hank Azaria with a Swedish-chef accent and Brad Pitt and Matt Damon as a pair of krill who oh-so-wackily venture off on their own. Couple that with a story that lopes along (remember Jason Mewes’ description of Lord of the Rings in Clerks II? That’s what this feels like), and Happy Feet Two ends up being perhaps the slowest 90-odd minutes I’ve spent in a theatre all year. Until it rallies somewhat in the final real with a production number set to “Under Pressure,” there’s nothing in this movie that provides any evidence that anybody involved actually cared about making this unique and special. It’s clear that Warner Brothers knew what they had on their hands, what with opening it opposite the new Twilight movie and all.","en_US.blogs",941

I'm of two minds on this. Kennedy is right that district attorneys shouldn't pursue a shaming policy until they have a conviction. But at the same time I applaud the initiative of Brian Baugh, the University of North Texas student behind the Denton twitter blotter. He's not out to shame, he's out to make public information truly public. I wrote in March that a 21st-century police blotter could be a new revenue stream for flagging media organizations. Baugh's twitter mashup takes us in that direction. If law enforcement agencies take up twitter blotters, they will need to include strong disclaimers that accounts posted are accusations and that nobody has been convicted. But initiatives like this aren't pure sensationalism -- they're one part sensational and one part public service. We're obsessed with crime, and that's our problem, not one to be solved by the media or the police.

Properly designed incentives could serve a dual purpose, providing a valuable financial incentive for management to stay with the company and creating a funding vehicle for a potential management buyout, should the current owner choose such an exit strategy.

Neither man ends up satisfied with his revenge.

Mr Bird had given evidence to the commission dealing with this case, where he had stated that the NotW had not employed any private investigators in relation to this case. Mr Sheridan made reference to that response, calling it a “lie” in light of Mr Bird’s subsequent evidence. Mr Bird replied that the NotW had employed a private investigator to try and find Duncan Rowan, but as the investigator had not found him he had forgotten about it. Mr Bird admitted he had “got that wrong” and when he had checked he had found that “one instance.”","en_US.blogs",1124

And she fights for what she loves, because she is compelled to. Violet’s story is unique to her, I don’t pull on parallel scenarios from my own life, but I do pull on the emotion of intense love.

In the last twenty- five years (if Mick’s new group Carbon/ Silicon is his answer, pray that Jah sends him more songs) only the U.K. band Wire has for me sporadically reached that same blast furnace intensity that was The Clash’s calling card. Everybody’s so obsessed with experimenting out on the fringe of electronica, funk, rap, and world music that we forgot about the template that has never failed when done right: two guitars, bass and drums. What we are still desperate for in 2008 is a real rock band. We need a group that could invent their own I Fought the Law, a group that plays every night like it might be their last. I read Mojo, and have listened to Franz Ferdinand, The Kaiser Chiefs and all the other latest Next Big Things that they trumpet about each month. What eventually happens is that they all wind up swiggin’ Dom Perignon in St. Bart’s with a supermodel on their arm, that’s the only thing you can learn from The Mick Jagger School of Rock. You can have U-2 with all their managers and accountants, I’m looking for something real, something that doesn’t have a marketing plan in place before they even plug in for the recording session.","en_US.blogs",1178

I received word from my youngest son that he had been promoted to manager of the Bunge facility, formerly Central Soya, in Decatur! He graduated from Tri State with a mechanical engineering degree after serving 8 years in the army, three of them in Germany, where I had the privilege of visiting him. Just before graduation they purchased a home in Decatur. We wanted to question the advisability of this because it would limit his choices of employment. Fortunately our theory of keeping our noses out of our kids lives was the right one. We were available for advice and support but not control. He accepted a position at this facility that was about three blocks from their new home! It is a fantastic feeling when as Sam Levinson, an author who had his own television show years ago, said, ”It is great when others say nice things about your kids.” Success is usually the combination of the co-operation and support of family members.

"11413","1. The Artist – So if anyone’s known me long enough, they’ve probably heard me (or read me) mention how modern talented film-makers should tackle silent films. Well, Michel Hazanavicius listened to me and in doing so totally proved my point. He made a work of art that is setting the film world on fire. Part of me hopes this inspires a wave of copycat silent films (many of which would invariably be inferior, but some of them would probably demonstrate the creativity that silent films brought out in film-makers). By using a technique that hasn’t really been commonly done in eight decades or so, Michel Hazanavicius highlights one of the key rules in art and in indeed life in general: adapt or die. George Valentin’s reluctance to embrace new technology is almost his undoing. He survives only by adjusting to the new style of the medium. It may seem odd to technologically regress in order to make a case for advancement but it makes the whole thing even more poetic. Anyway, I know I’m hardly daring or original as pegging The Artist as the best picture of the year but it got me.","en_US.blogs",1413

Constant, probing stories about the triumphs and agonies of people on the margins help to effect remedies and turn barriers into bridges.","en_US.blogs",1430

How do we know what’s working? How do we know what readers are doing with advertising in apps and on digital devices? Those are very, very good and valuable questions. So I think what we have to do is help advertisers understand that there are different ways to use our various brands and products to reach the audience and it isn’t necessarily one size fits all. The CMR will open up a conversation about data without having to justify where it’s come from or the authority of the data.

Fear not, I will still do my usual goofy comedy blogs, intermixed with the occasional delusional political rant, non-stop complaining and whining about my physical health, and the ever-so-rare serious post or two, while I sneak these music posts onto the blog each evening. I really love music and will listen to almost anything that is out there. I really loved the music of the 70′s and 80′s and my flashback blog was a way for me to revisit a bunch of the great music and artists of that time frame. These music flashbacks will hopefully take those of you my age back to some fond memories. For those of you that are young, chances are you may have not heard of some of these artists. I’ll post a different musical flashback each evening until all the posts off my flashback blog have been transferred. Once I have them done, ya’ll can help me make a list of all the great artists I have yet to get to from that era. Why am I transferring these instead of just resuming blogging on my flashback blog?

"11574","""To those who have ever known sound, true silence can be but a myth. It is a phantasm, and something to be feared, for in silence we are vulnerable to our own conscience and its persistent echoes of memory, desire and confusion; we lose the means of dismissal and voluntary ignorance and become vulnerable. In silence we are naked, stripped of the sound layers we have used to define ourselves to outside eyes, a defensive muffling of truths. Today we abjure silence, avoiding its solitude. We are in a constant conversation with an ultra-social and info-overdosed humanity repeatedly relaying sculptures of mundane phrases that numb us to the experience of meaning. We dare not lie still enough to stir or coax the phantom film reels of our past from their shadows. Instead we light fires, shouting and stamping our feet to drive back the dark and its inhabitants. It is our fear of the silence of the void, the vacuum. Humanity cannot see nothingness but we run from it, choking the subtle sound of our own breathing with the bustling of contemporary life where everything is virtual and reality utterly abandoned. We convince ourselves we grow by sponging up the noises of the clattering world that engulfs us. In silence we are trapped as we are made to face the cold starkness of what we feel is missing, or the fierce jab of what we long to erase. We stand in silence and we stand in a room of mirrors. A ticking clock is a heartbeat.","en_US.blogs",1574

He loved it, but it broke after a month or so. Customer service was highly uncooperative so I was on the hunt for a replacement of the Baby Einstein or Fisher Price variety for cheap. Then I found an online Target coupon for 50% off Fisher Price toys….and the music table qualified. There also was a coupon for 50% of select Disney Princess items. It was like a sale just for my kids. Although Ryan’s gift was technically a replacement, any mother knows, one kid gets something, the other wants something.

That is not only very rude, but it is quite lazy; not only on the authors part, but on the characters part as well. It wouldn’t kill them to go find a rubbish bin. But Sweetly does not indulge in any of these horrors. It establishes it’s setting, and then proceeds to flaunt it to every advantage until the end, where the powers that be decided that the beach would be a far more fashionable accessory, and packed off our characters into a car to search out the ocean. I suppose you might say that the treatment of the setting is a bit like the treatment of a baby born to rich parents. Ahem. Other than doing a wonderful job of supporting the book, I think it was interesting how the archetypal small town in the middle of nowhere setting was utilised. The majority of the time, the characters are trying to escape, to distance themselves from these apparently soul-sucking locations (although I do hope I’m not the first to realise they spend more time moaning about this than taking the initiative to stow away on some boat to the nearest port city.). Sweetly is an exception to this tradition, which resulted in mentors and companions booting the poor book off of their pathway and into the dark and presumably terrifying forest, infested with such scary creatures as racoons, and small rodents. I mean, the characters in Sweetly feel drawn to this small town full of whiny bigots, and want to stay there.

You are free to fry your lung through cigars or cigarettes but don’t blame others when cancer comes knocking on your doors. You see, that is the beauty of a society that appeals to the individualistic tendencies of man, for it allows man to make decisions on his own and face the harsh consequence of it. People should be prepared to face whatever it is that comes with the decisions that they make, they should never blame others nor expect sympathy or help from others. But this is not to say that we humans should be selfish and refuse to help the needy. Which is why I am truly adhere to the idea of Charity, for this is an action that FREE individuals take. FREE individuals help the needy not because someone (state) forces them to do it, FREE individuals help others out of their own will; they do it voluntarily. Isn’t it much more desirable when you give something to the needy when you do it out of your own free will? And besides, take this for example: if I give my 100 directly to the needy I’m pretty much sure that he/she will get it fully, but if I give my 100 pesos to a third-party (state) how can I be so sure that the third-party will give the full amount to the needy?","en_US.blogs",1701

And, our Prime Minister has previously shared his personal views on sexual orientation, before it was politically prudent to remain silent. He has eroded the office of the Status of Women, and has promoted aid programs that focus on abstinence, while ignoring women`s reproductive rights. There is currently no abortion law in Canada, as it was struck down by the Supreme Court a number of years ago - but a conservative majority might try to change this. In spite of the fact that Harper says gay marriage and abortion rights are not part of his platform, I simply don`t believe him. He voted against the recent Transgender Rights bill - which was passed, but then died as a result of the election. This government is completely lacking in transparency and accountability - I don`t think this will improve if they are given more power. Canada`s human rights record has been tarnished since Harper took office, and he has taken several large steps backwards with regards to environmental protection.","en_US.blogs",1714

Miguel, who is the Assistant District Attorney, comes off as a cool, clean cut guy, and the perfect partner in crime for Dexter. Unfortunately for all parties, once Miguel gets a taste for killing he goes from friend and apprentice of Dexter to a notable adversary. Like Lila, Miguel doesn’t rack up the bodies like some of the villains further down the list but he does cause aggravation and danger for our favorite serial killer, Dexter. In the end Miguel meets his match at the hands of Dexter.","en_US.blogs",1762

So I continued to insist that we wait while Luisito continued to want children whenever would say yes.

She had an unusual appearance, which she had alluded to by saying that she looked and felt like a “hybrid” and didn’t fit in with her family, and I had been trying to figure out her exact ethnic background. She said that she had been told she was to do something important in her home country, and she wondered whether she would be going there to live, staying in the US, or going back and forth. She thought that perhaps she was meant to go into politics. This brought forth a cornucopia of images, which, again, I felt like I was getting on my own, not being shown by any entity but her. It looked like she was going to be a bridge between the two countries in some way. I wasn’t sure exactly what sort of work she was going to do, but I felt that she was a kind of cultural ambassador or head of a social organization rather than a politician. I could see her surrounded by crowds of people, who were delighted that she was there. The people were holding banners with writing on them, which I couldn’t read, not because of a language problem but because the picture was too vague. There were flowers all around, as if the event was some kind of celebration. I also could feel distinctly that in this vision, her family was overjoyed to see her. As things were in our mundane present, they missed her terribly; I felt this as a cord pulling on her, which she was resisting. By my standards, this was a spectacular amount of vivid material. I was pretty clear about it all, but I expressed myself diffidently and as if everything was a question, like, “Um, it’s in Asia?”","en_US.blogs",1815

(Also, its position in the baths of Hadrian, looking downward into a pool, has a set of imagery that suggests Narcissus; and the pose is not only also reminiscent of Narcissus, but she suggests could further allude to Endymion, Hylas, Hyakinthos, or even Hermaphroditus!) Echmoun was the principal deity of the Phoenician city of Sidon, which is where the colony of Leptis Magna was founded from. Various accounts state that Echmoun was the eighth son (with no mother) from a Phoenician god perhaps identified with the Dioskouroi or Apollon, and his very name means “eighth.” In the Apollonian versions, Echmoun is either syncretized as his son Asklepios, or considered a further son of Apollon. In later versions of his myth, he is a hunter and considered similar to Adonis, and in some versions, he is said to have been in love with Astronoe (a goddess syncretized to Astarte or Aphrodite), and to have castrated himself for her in the same way that Attis did for Cybele; but, she brought him back to life and made him a healer with the warmth of her own body. Coins from the reign of Elagabulus in the third century show Echmoun as a youthful, beardless and beautiful ephebe, very much like Antinous.","en_US.blogs",1927

But unknown to them, a powerful clan also lived in the islands, a group of beings who can transform themselves into powerful wolves – the Taong Lobos. The Taong Lobos were the humans’ protectors and they immediately formed an army to destroy the vampires. The blood drinkers were no match to the Taong Lobos. One by one, they fell. Those who survived were driven into hiding. What followed was peace among the humans and taong lobos, and the memory of the vampires started to fade. But the vampires are only lying in wait – organizing and fortifying their numbers until they are ready. They are holding a secret – a prophecy that foretells of an epic battle between them and the Taong Lobos that will finally decide the one blood that shall rule all. The battle shall be led by a powerful vampire and a powerful taong lobo who are each others nemesis and downfall. The vampires believe they have found their prophesied savior and now they are preparing to come out and start the war. The Taong Lobos have grown complacent, and they know nothing about the prophecy. With the stage set for an epic battle, two individuals, Mateo and Lia, find themselves drawn to each other, unsuspecting that as they grow closer together, they are awakening the powers that are lying dormant in both of them – the same powers that will inevitably tear them apart.","en_US.blogs",1957

"12202","My understanding of the effects of neocortical inhibition in childbirth has been reactivated about ten years later through another significant anecdote. A young mother was celebrating the birth of her one day old baby in a double bedroom. Her neighbour was in prelabour. This is how glasses of champagne were exchanged. The effect of champagne was so spectacular that a baby was born through a ‘fetus ejection reflex’ on the way to the birthing room.3 It is well known that champagne is a special wine. Thanks to the bubbles, alcohol is brought immediately to the brain. The ability of alcohol to change human consciousness has been known for ages. Today we understand how alcohol works: one of its effects is to bind to the GABA receptors.4","en_US.blogs",2202

But when push comes to shove and the ground beneath the euro looks ominously unstable, the euro powers have converged towards a closer Euro, not a more disintegrated one. This will be the path that follows. Europe’s leaders have a high pain threshold and will not be forced into doing things they don’t want to do unless a gun is pointed at their heads. The euro crisis gun is reloading and eventually greater integration will follow.","en_US.blogs",2212

"12250","It was also from this quote in which Neil’s next three albums (Time Fades Away, On The Beach, and Tonight’s The Night) were given the title of The Ditch Trilogy. In addition to this a few months after the death of Danny Whitten friend and roadie Bruce Berry passed away in a similar fashion. Young’s next release was the live album Time Fades Away that was released in 1973. This album was not like other live albums in many ways for one, it was a live album composed of previously unreleased material, which was unheard of at the time. Time Fades Away was recorded directly from the soundboard onto a 16 track Quad 8 CompuMix, which was the first digital mixing soundboard. This was done at the request of Young, producer David Briggs was strongly against this method. As a result of this unorthodox recording approach (a proper master tape was never made) the album features a muddy sounding mix. Time Fades Away was released on Vinyl, Cassette and 8 Track tape in October of 1973. Neil Young has been very outspoken as his dissatisfaction with this album. He has stated that it is his “worst release”, as a result Time Fades Away has never been released on CD. In 1995 a CD release was planned and test pressings were even made, but it was shelved and not released. Recently, it has been stated that it will be released on Neil Young’s second volume of his Archives Box Set along with Time Fades Away II. Young has been quoted from Guitar World in 2009 as saying about Time Fades Away II “It's a completely different thing, with completely different songs”","en_US.blogs",2250

"12400","Fifth and finally, we return to the domestic level to assess whether several decades of discussion, negotiation, and litigation have resulted in significant reform and/or convergence of the two regulatory systems. We demonstrate that, despite some domestic changes on each side, the US and EU regulatory systems for agricultural biotechnology show few signs of real convergence toward a common regulatory model. There has, nonetheless, been some domestic change on both sides of the Atlantic, due at least in part to external pressures from international markets and international regimes. In the EU, the Commission and biotech companies have been somewhat empowered by international developments to resume approvals of new GM varieties after a long moratorium and to challenge member state bans against those already formally approved. On the US side, meanwhile, regulators have increased requirements for trials before the commercial release of many GM seeds so that these varieties, in fact, are treated distinctly from more conventional ones, despite official US proclamations to the contrary. Even in the absence of tightened regulation, moreover, US farmers have demonstrated a reluctance to adopt new GM foods and crops which they fear will be rejected in the EU and other large export markets. The overall picture, we argue, is one in which the two regulatory systems for GM foods and crops remain essentially polarized, but where key actors on both sides struggle to minimize the economic impacts and political tensions of persistent regulatory differences.","en_US.blogs",2400

The Spanish crown had ruled its American colonies through vice regencies, with the former Aztec Empire, the former Incan Empire, and Buenos Aires being the three largest. One-fifth of all of the gold, precious stones and other wealth extracted from the Americas were the property of the King. The viceroys, who represented the King and were appointed for five year terms, and other key holders of power had to be not only pure Europeans but they had to have been born in Europe. Europeans born in Latin America were referred to as criollos or Creoles. Although they might accumulate great material wealth, they could not hold political office. This sense of political disenfranchisement, as well as Spain’s insistence on being Latin America’s only European trade partner, led to a growing sense of alienation and to the calls to follow the example of the colonies of North America by gaining independence from Spain.","en_US.blogs",2407

I decided to go down to South Norwalk and check out The SoNo Baking Company and Cafe that Martha Stewart is always yammering on about on Martha. This tiny hidden jewel was started by John Barricelli, who works for Martha and also hosts Everyday Baking on PBS. It is Fa. Bu. Lous. Seriously, that good. We had lunch and I tried a Cobb Salad that elevated the usual blah salad to a culinary masterpiece. I sat at the counter in front of a huge glass window and watched people roll out chocolate croissants with a vintage roller while I ate. (If you are a big geek, that is a huge thrill.) At one point in the meal, I actually saw John Barricelli through the glass instructing one of the bakers on how to place the chocolate chunks perfectly in the croissant. I considered banging on the glass to blow kisses and get my photo taken with him but I decided I had done that enough recently with both her and her, so I decided to play it cool and just eat my lunch quietly. I also brought home a huge selection of pastries and enjoyed every single one (in the name of research, not gluttony, mind you). John is coming out with a cookbook in early March. You can be a geek like me and pre-order your copy on Amazon today. The cafe is located right near the South Norwalk Aquarium and makes a good drive on a cold winter's day.","en_US.blogs",2463

When Brown says that one of the bad things about a strong leader is that he or she stands in the way of the aspirations of others, you can take him at his word.

"12506","Do you recall the “DC sniper” who terrorized the Washington, D.C. metro area in 2002? There were all kinds of theories concerning John Allen Muhammad who, along with a younger man, randomly killed people until finally being caught. In Scared Silent ($15.00, Atria Books, softcover) his former wife, Mildred Muhammad, reveals that the killings were part of his plan to ultimately kill her and make it appear she was just one of the sniper’s random victims despite the fact she was the mother of three of his children. This is on one level a story of domestic violence, but it is also a look at the twisted mind of a man who could have lived a normal life and threw it away as his rage overtook him. And it is a story of a woman unable to secure the help she needed from law enforcement authorities until too many people were dead. Criminal Minds: Sociopaths, Serial Killers & Other Deviants ($17.95, Wiley, softcover) is not light reading. Jeff Mariotte has written an authorized companion to the hit TV series, providing the stories behind serial killers such as David Berkowitz and Henry Lee Lucas, sexual predators, killers with famous victims, cannibals like Jeffrey Dahmer, traveling killers such as Ted Bundy, and a whole cast of quite loathsome lunatics. If that’s your cup of tea, this book will more than satisfy your interest. In A Peculiar Tribe of People: Murder in the Heart of Georgia ($24.95, Lyons Press) Richard Jay Hutto takes a close look at Chester Burge, described as a slumlord, liquor runner, and black sheep of a wealthy family. In early 1960 when his wife was murdered, suspicion fell on Chester and in the ensuing trial the quiet community of Macon was treated to a story of totally grotesque dimensions in which every social and sexual taboo was broken. The South of that era is the backdrop to the story. It makes for very compelling reading.","en_US.blogs",2506

So when D called me the other day to let me know his power steering had mysteriously gone out...it about sent me over the edge.

"12636","The movie was filmed on location on the Milwaukee Road’s Rocky Mountain division in 1930. This line was part of the Milwaukee’s Pacific Extension that extended the railroad from its Main core in Illinois, Wisconsin and Iowa out to the Pacific Ocean. It was also the first Transcontinental route to be abandoned. When the Milwaukee Road filed for bankruptcy for the final time in the late 1970′s, The court appointed trustee decided to eliminate as many miles as possible from the railroad in order to save cost’s. In 1979, the entire route west of Terry, Montana was abandoned. It is Ironic that this line was abandoned, because it was the best engineered route through the west. At 1,100 mile, this was the largest abandonment of a railroad in history, until the next year, when the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific (Rock Island Railroad) completely abandoned its railroad (7,000+ miles). The Milwaukee did not last much longer, and in 1986, the railroad was bought and merged into the Soo Line Railroad.","en_US.blogs",2636

The overall agreement within this interview was simply “Christians need to know their history and some of the people within it better“. Part of this thought comes from the statistical fact in which many say they dislike studying history; though I think math’s still considered the worst. Although this is in regard to general history, it is arguable many Christians don’t even know much about some of the figures who had affected their present spiritual lives. Because of this fact, Ken Lambert and others cowrote and published this book.","en_US.blogs",2638

Oh boy, thank God, thank.the.Dear. Lord. He spared me. And the least of reasons was for this quilt.

You’d think we’d be feeling elated, but after having spent nearly every weekend for the better part of the last year preparing for this moment, what I’m feeling is a kind of post-academic project postpartum depression. Alcohol. We need alcohol, stat. The only obstacle to obtaining said alcohol is that neither K nor I are willing to purchase a $40.00 bottle of wine from the Hotel restaurant. Then, of course, there’s the problem of inquiring at the front desk where we can obtain less-than-$40.00 adult beverages without appearing a: cheep, or b: like the functioning alcoholics we most certainly are not.

Then the intermediates were struggling a little and we were very quick at that part of the race and then with the dry tyres it was again the same thing. Very slow at the beginning when the track was damp and very quick when the track was dry so I knew that it was a race to be calm, to put the car on the track always, no mistakes, not being off the track at any moment as the grass is very wet and with no mistakes I knew the car had enough pace to fight for the victory.

Macpherson’s willingness to accept without question that the whites who assaulted Stephen Lawrence used the word “nigger” is contrasted with his readiness to doubt the possibility that Brooks used grossly offensive language when the police arrived at the scene of the murder (“pigs” being one of the milder words, see para, 5.13). Macpherson concedes, grudgingly, that Brooks said these things and admits that such offensive language may explain why he was ignored by the police at the hospital (para, 5.13). Nevertheless, ever willing to find fault with the police, Macpherson asserts, too, that: ‘We do not believe that a young white man in a similar position would have been dealt with in the same way’ (para, 5.31). Why are we to believe that a young white man who called the police “cunts” and “pigs” at the scene of a murder and who behaved in an aggressive manner would not have been treated in this way? To take this further, are we to believe that had Brooks been white he would not have been arrested for (allegedly) causing damage to a car? (para, 5.27).","en_US.blogs",2811

When the kids were doing arts and crafts, Kendall was in a room by herself with her nurse because she couldn't get a grip and would have been disturbing the other kids. It sucks. It isn't fair.

It was the first national park established in Ireland, created when Muckross Estate was donated to the Irish state in 1932. The park has since been substantially expanded and encompasses over 25,425 acres of diverse ecology, including the Lakes of Killarney, Oak and Yew woodlands, and mountain peaks. It has Ireland’s only native herd of Red Deer and the most extensive covering of native forest remaining in Ireland. The park is of high ecological value because of the quality, diversity, and extensiveness of many of its habitats and the wide variety of species that they accommodate, some of which are rare. The park was designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1981.","en_US.blogs",2858

That year also featured the release of her crossover hit I Fall To Pieces. 1961 had more trials in store, however, and the singer was given her second near-death experience when she and her brother were involved in a head-on collision while driving in Nashville. Cline was thrown through the windshield by the crash, and received a life-threatening gash across her forehead and a dislocated hip. While recovering in the hospital afterwards, she heard a tribute sung for her on the radio by up-and-coming singer Loretta Lynn; the two meet soon afterwards and immediately became close friends.","en_US.blogs",2879

Shiver of the Vampires is usually billed as an exploitation movie, and it does deliver on some of the goods. On the one hand, there is very little violence, and what we are given is very discreet. However, this being a Jean Rollin movie there is plenty of female nudity; from Dominique’s outfits, to the translucent veils worn by the servants that Rollin put on a lot of his female characters, to Sandra Julien constantly wandering around in the buff. I ain’t complaining. I should point out, though, that aside from one very brief throwaway scene, it tends to be less tawdry and more chaste and artistic.","en_US.blogs",2899

At first, I was feeling great and sure this was the best decision for me and my health. Then slowly, I started having the joint pains again-this time with more frequency and pain. Then I would randomly eat gluten in small amounts, mainly when out of town. Now, even when I have absolutely no gluten, I'm still having the pains intermittently. However, I am still gluten free. I still make exceptions when traveling by eating a meal or snack with gluten in it. At home, I am almost always GF. I have found out some things I was eating were not actually GF, even though one would assume so. I guess I need to keep checking even if I assume it ""should be"" GF. I have been reading about osteoarthritis and feel like I'm on that track since I have rheumatoid arthritis. Maybe I'm just reaching for answers.I need to lose weight-about 30 pounds. I think I'm going to have to get back on Weight Watchers and also watch my gluten intake.

Traditional heist stories involve a group of people all working together to steal something. Some examples include The Perfect Score and The Italian Job. These are appealing to me because there is more than just stealing going on. There is a sense of togetherness and a sense of identity. Everyone knows his or her role, and they all must work together perfectly to pull the heist off. I can't hear the word ""heist"" and not smile.","en_US.blogs",2968

"13052","Author Summary: The narrow-sense heritability of a trait such as body-mass index is a measure of the variability of the trait between people that is accounted for by their additive genetic differences. Knowledge of these genetic differences provides insight into biological mechanisms and hence treatments for diseases. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) survey a large set of genetic markers common to the population. They have identified several single markers that are associated with traits and diseases. However, these markers do not seem to account for all of the known narrow-sense heritability. Here we used a recently developed model to quantify the genetic information contained in GWAS for single traits and shared between traits. We specifically investigated metabolic syndrome traits that are associated with type 2 diabetes and heart disease, and we found that for the majority of these traits much of the previously unaccounted for heritability is contained within common markers surveyed in GWAS. We also computed the genetic correlation between traits, which is a measure of the genetic components shared by traits. We found that the genetic correlation between these traits could be predicted from their phenotypic correlation.","en_US.blogs",3052

"13078","There are different ways in which one could articulate such an inquiry. The key question here is what resources one is entitled to use in explaining the deontic notions (obligation and permission). I take it that these notions are to be understood in terms of practical rationality (i.e., in terms of the way they function as reasons for and against action), which itself can only be understood alongside theoretical rationality (i.e., in terms of the notion of reasons per se). However, I also take it that rationality must itself be understood in deontic terms. On the one hand, the force of reasons is a matter of obliging (dispositive reasons) or entitling (probative reasons) one to adopt a conclusion. On the other, there are general obligations one undertakes insofar as one is involved in any reasoning at all (e.g., the obligation to work out the consequences of one’s commitments and the obligation to eliminate any incompatibilities amongst them by retracting some of them). As such, I take it that the deontic notions cannot be explained in non-deontic terms. However, this does not mean that this explanatory strategy locks us into a vicious circle. Instead, we can see this strategy as embodying a virtuous circle, in which, although we do not reduce the deontic to something else, we nonetheless make explicit its structure by way of the specific obligations which constitute the structure of rationality.","en_US.blogs",3078

The political drama over the opening up of the retail sector to foreign investment is significant, not on account of whatever might happen to the immediate issue, but for what it says about the prospects of any kind of economic reform. In and of itself, the opening up of the retail sector is not hugely important, except as a signal that the government is still capable of taking decisions. The real message is that it has become impossible to reform India. If an innocuous decision on retail creates near-unanimous opposition, including from members of the ruling alliance and important people in the Congress itself, what prospects can there possibly be for labour reform, or cutting out the waste in all the government boondoggles dished out in the name of poverty alleviation? The larger message is that India’s political class has no time for economic reform, and no understanding of the need for it in an uncertain world where China becomes more powerful day by day on the strength of its superior economic performance.","en_US.blogs",3116

While wandering the museum at night was a lovely experience in its own right, the only real thing of note that happened to me was toward the end of the night, when I and two other women were stationed in Mary’s room on the second floor of the house. We were completely alone in the building when we distinctly heard the front screen door move, and then the sound of someone quietly moving about downstairs. We honestly believed someone had come into the house, but no one answered our calls, and finally we tiptoed downstairs to see what we could find. No one was there, but we kept hearing a clicking noise in the vicinity of the organ in the Victorian parlor, as if someone were pressing down on the keys. Now Violet did play the organ for her church, so in my heart I kind of hope it was her we were hearing. Nothing else of significance happened during the investigation, but of course there is much audio still to be gone through, so hope springs eternal that perhaps Violet or one of the other spirits of Weems-Botts spoke to us. If not, it still was anything but a wasted trip, just for the wealth of historical information (and the divine red velvet cupcakes) we received from the knowledgeable and gracious staff. If you ever head to DC to check out its rich cultural offerings, make time to stop off at the Weems-Botts Museum in Dumfries.

Is it Malema, the man that has been their pawn all along, is it Zuma & co that officially led them in or is it someone else behind the scenes? If they back the wrong group they're doomed and there is no such thing as the right group. In SA we do not have only one or two tribes, we have at least thirteen different tribes and groups to contend with. In SA we have unresolved friction and hatred between groups and tribes spanning centuries. We have rebel groups, revolutionaries, disgruntled loyalists, political parties with different political ideologies, we have blacks hating blacks, blacks hating whites, whites hating blacks, coloureds hating blacks and we have whites hating whites. We have Asians, Portuguese, Afrikaners, Boers, Greeks, Italians, Germans, Dutch, British, etc. We have churches hating each other and different religions hating each other. South Africa is a country thriving on hate and discrimination from all directions. It is the most most diverse, most divided country on earth. According to psychologists South Africans are the most aggressive people in the world. They certainly are the most judgemental and most hypocritical of all. South Africans judge you because you belong to the wrong church, speak the wrong language, live in the wrong suburb, wear the wrong clothes, etc. They judge those that left the country and those that left judge those that stayed behind. This is the most screwed and most screwed-up nation on earth and China is about to learn it the hard way.","en_US.blogs",3288

Then, we could see what kind of children result from these various mating strategies. Also, each of these mice in all of the various arrangements would be taken from monogamous lines, to see if sperm mutations are affected by any arrangement. For the third and fourth arrangements, it may be easier simply to make the ratio of males to the single female quite high, so high in fact that she is incapable of mating with all of the males in a given sexual period, thereby eliminating the need to herd her into one particular group of males (and away from the others) at a time.","en_US.blogs",3391

Sure I was. I mean who doesn't love to watch gay men in leather jackets acting tough after dark? And, as everyone knows, the daylight is a cruel mistress, one that will eventually destroy the darkness. I think the lyrics to the Meri D.

"13427","To keep on topic, I ask. Does Ephesians 5 instruct husbands to act as prophet, priest or king for their families? Not directly. It uses a metaphor that describes the priestly and prophetic role of Christ. Metaphors are tricky because they are so successful… the purpose of a metaphor is transfer the meaning of one phrase to another. But metaphors are not meant to be literal. To understand what it means, we start by asking what it doesn’t mean. I think we all agree that husbands do not literally become Christ. Husbands do not literally atone for their wives’ sin. Husbands are not the voice of God to their wives. Husbands do not have absolute authority over their wives’ lives. How do we know this? Because of clear passages elsewhere. So, attributing the roles of prophet, priest and king to husband is not accurate.","en_US.blogs",3427

"13431","So, with memories brought to the surface, I used my photo organizing software (acdsee) to pull up photos from our last visit to Casa Loma. We took our kids there in 2004, so that I could pass the thrill on to them, and they loved it! Going through the photos, though, I noticed a common problem because of the size of the building and the tall towers. Because you are shooting from ground level and looking up, the sides of the building appear to be bending inwards and the whole castle itself seems to be leaning backwards. According to a website I found, this is a common perspective problem called keystoning, and it’s caused by the building and the camera lens being on two different angles. This particular website gave step by step instructions on how to fix the problem, so I decided to give it a try. I have Photoshop CS5, but I only know the basics of photo editing, so this was a challenge for me. Here are the before and after photos of two shots. I know they are far from perfect, but this was just my first, very quick try, and I was amazed at the improvement.

"13446","The story in Small Pond follows a Kirsten, a directionless twentysomething woman who has been sucked into life in her small mid-western college town. She's on the cusp of either embracing life as a townie or finding some way out. She doesn't have any ambition and she has a hipster disdain of most of the people she meets. And she's irresponsible and not entirely in control of her impulses. Her landlord is selling the house where she lives and he's told her that she and her roommate have the right of first refusal, should they want the house. She works a dead end job in a pizza parlor. She spends her nights in a drunken haze, dodging people she finds annoying. Lynn, her roommate is fed up with her, particularly her penchant for providing nothing to the fridge in the way of food (and eating what Lynn herself provides). Her other friend, Katie, she's known since they were kids, but Katie has become one of those New Age-y people that Kirsten can't really abide. Kirsten views Katie as a kind of tag along. She's short of friends, though, so she can't really afford to lose any. Kirsten also declines a promotion at her job--foolishly it turns out--that would provide her with medical benefits. When she has a ghastly accident late in the movie with some stolen whip-its, it provides her with an existential crisis of identity. The time has come, it seems, to finally take her life in hand...","en_US.blogs",3446

Recognising different parts of the milonga: tendency in milonga to use major and minor keys ('happy' and 'sad') alternately in sections. There are sections of a milonga with the traspie beat/rhythm, and there are sections without it when we dance lisse. Occasionally there are sections where we hear the traspie beat, but the melody is so smooth that we would naturally dance lisse. We walk through a milonga several times to get familiar with the sections in the music and rhythms, then dance it in open embrace with a partner, then again, swapping roles. We study and practice three milongas in this way. The method is practical and well-organised.","en_US.blogs",3550

I concluded that there was an observable interdependency between the four ingredients listed above where publicity, for example, could not be achieved unless the remaining three ingredients were present. Based on that interdependency, I suggested that the four ingredients do in fact combine and interlock to form a single right of confrontation. I then suggested that the four ingredients could be arranaged into a hierarchy of importance based on whether the existence of one of the ingredients of the right was dependant upon the existence of one or more the other three. To cut a long story short, I suggested that the disclosure of the real legal identity of witnesses was the most the important of the four ingredients because the satisfaction of that element could not be achieved by the existence of the any of the remaining three.","en_US.blogs",3591

It's one thing to serve Cheez Whiz, Cool Whip, and onion soup mix (I'm looking at you Sandra Lee), but if butter is your biggest sin, then look in the mirror before criticizing anyone else.","en_US.blogs",3741

Aggra definitely seems to be an orc woman on a mission, and that is to affect a great change in Thrall. The storytellers seem to lend their approval to this, even if it is tacit approval at times, by slowly nudging Thrall toward what she desires of him. Deus ex machina allows them to tweak his innermost desires to be in line with her own. This is a place where I could call foul, because it seems very, very convenient for them to do so. As a storyteller myself, I believe a character like Thrall may well have his sense of duty eschew all else, because it is one thing that he has possessed all this time — while a wife and children remained distant from him, a dream.","en_US.blogs",3822

"13855","The real trick comes next. At some point, S1 decides to relocate (at least on paper) its headquarters to Bermuda, which has no income tax. The company becomes a “dual resident,” which means that, from the Irish point of view, it’s subject to Bermuda tax law, but from the U.S. perspective, it’s still incorporated in Ireland. To complete the scheme, the parent company then sets up a second Irish subsidiary (S2), which, importantly, chooses not to beconsidered a corporation under U.S. law; this has the effect of hiding its finances from the IRS. Why are two Irish subsidiaries better than one? Because now S1 can license the parent company’s products to S2 in exchange for a stream of hefty royalty checks.

But the royalties it’s paying to S1 can be deducted from its income.

The United States Congressional records show that HAARP is funded by the US government. The U.S. Senate set aside $15 million dollars in 1996 (Clinton administration) to develop the ability to penetrate the earth with signals bounced off of the ionosphere. This earth-penetrating-tomography has since been developed and used by the US government to look inside the planet to a depth of many kilometers in order to locate underground munitions, minerals and tunnels. The problem is that the frequencies used by HAARP for earth-penetrating tomography is also within the frequency range most cited for disruption of earth’s own electromagnetic field.","en_US.blogs",3865

It is the apex of a craft; it is the concentration of knowledge, uniquely font-ed, laboriously printed and painstakingly assembled. It is the transmission of the thoughts of one human being (sometimes more) to another, passed on by the attentive hands of publishers and bookbinders. And while the crafting of books has gone from the extraordinarily laborious (vellum and homemade ink and illuminations) to the more mundane (paper and industrial ink), the process is not less marvelous.","en_US.blogs",4004

Many in his community are regarding this as a miracle and are seeking to have him canonized into sainthood — to have him officially recognized by the Vatican as a saint. Part of the canonization process involves documented miracles, as defined by the first definition above. Without any further thought on the matter, we immediately began praying for Fr. Joseph Cappel to intercede on our behalf and on behalf of this little baby! A specific prayer was written out in the letter to put forward when praying for a miracle:","en_US.blogs",4085

They smelled like arrogance and death. As I charged down the slopes, I could practically taste the blood of the shadows. I could smell the excitement of the hunt.

"14211","The coronation procession makes its way through the streets of Rome to the Basilica as people cheer and kneel and pray and kiss the ground the pope’s walked on. Inside the Basilica, Alexander is crowned with the papal triple tiara, an awed and humbled look on his face. Oddly, Cesare watches the coronation from the audience, with his family, dressed in what appears to be civilian garb. He’s a bishop, shouldn’t he be participating in some way, or at least sitting with the other princes of the church? Seems strange. As Alexander’s new titles are announced, Lucrezia asks if, now their father’s the holy father, she’ll be called the holy daughter. Cesare says she’ll only change her name when she marries, and she’ll never marry, if he has anything to say about it. Ok, that’s a slightly creepy thing to say to one’s sister, but let’s just get something out of the way here. I don’t know if the show’s going to go in this direction, but all the historical rumors of Lucrezia sleeping with her brother were just that—rumors spread by the family’s many, many enemies who put the story around pretty much because it was the worst thing they could come up with. The vast majority of modern-day historians discredit the story, and even people at that time mostly thought it was nonsense, so I really, really hope the show doesn’t go there, because it’s so cheap and tawdry and unnecessary and mucks up the image of a woman who was, actually, a really interesting, intelligent, worthwhile individual. She and Cesare did have an extremely close, mutually worshipful relationship, but it was most likely nothing more than that.","en_US.blogs",4211

"14310","In the early 1990s the United States and the European Community used the weakness of the post-Soviet Russian leadership to impose economic and cultural embargo on all of the three peripheral states. The model was copied partly from the regime of sanctions the West imposed on the Comecon since 1948, known under the abbreviation of “Cocom” (Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls) forbidding all Western firms to export “strategic” commodities into the Rouble zone. By the way: the “Cocom”-embargo against Moscow survived the overthrow of the communist regime in 1991. Officially it was transformed in 1995 to an new regime of trade regulations called Wassenaar agreement. But the embargo-policy continued. So IBM was sentenced to a fine of 9 millions of US-Dollars because of selling high-tech-computers to Russia – and in this case we speak of the year 1998.","en_US.blogs",4310

While that is true in most cases (I’ve heard of parents paying for breast implants for their teenage daughters which is disgusting and negligent to say the least), mutilation of women in developing nations sometimes happens by choice, as well, out of fear of the social implications. Unfortunately, it also happens against women’s and girls’ free will. Neither is truly free will. If we as a society send messages to women and girls that they are inadequate, ugly, or less “feminine” if they don’t have large breasts, then the potential self-loathing or lack of self-esteem may drive women to the surgeon’s office. I’d say that this is less-than-voluntary and more like brainwashing. We’re bombarded with images of women in the media who look more like cartoon characters than human beings. Is it any surprise than women feel they can’t measure up? No human being can.","en_US.blogs",4328
"14329","For the last month or so I have been sporting some fantastically curious facial topiary on my boat race. Namely a 'handlebar' moustache. Ginger, wiry and oh so funky. Why? Well I recently got involved with a little project with the guys at Movember, purveyors of the 'Mo' and fundraisers extraordinaire, more of which I hope to divulge at a later date but naturally, any association with this charity requires a submission of the razor blade and a commitment to grow to a hairy caterpillar under your nose. So I went for it with great aplomb. I have to say though that opinion on the Mo has been divided, with some detractors commenting that I resemble a German porn star, a member of some cult or worse still, a Victorian paedophile. But other folk have been quite kind. Sophisticated, suave and sexy are just some of the adjectives that have swung my way, the latter coming from my good wife so I've persevered and I have to say, I reckon a lot of people are starting to look at me in a different light. Just the other day for instance, a gentleman in the public lavatory at Upminster station whispered across the urinals at me and asked if I was a friend of Dorothy. ""I might be"", I replied back, smiling conspiratorially before continuing with ""didn't she used to serve behind the bar at The Golden Lion in Romford?"" It turned out I that got the wrong Dorothy but still, he was a lovely guy to talk to. I've got his number at home, somewhere.","en_US.blogs",4329

In fact, I’m willing to bet Mr. Romney doesn’t have a problem with anyone who stays at home to do the hard work of raising a family as long as it happens without any financial assistance from government. What actually leads to the loss of dignity is the need for financial aid. Everybody likes to say that working at home as a mother might be the hardest form of work on the planet. But if that very hard work comes only with the assistance of government, then it really isn’t worth a damn and we’d be better off paying more to put the child in the hands of strangers so that everybody can have dignity. However, I’m pretty sure that if you asked most mothers they’d say that they’d rather stay at home and raise their child and suffer the loss of their dignity to people who don’t value their contribution to society’s future rather than have government pay to put the child in a daycare so that they can go to a job that they can run the risk of losing when they have to take off in order to take care of the child that got sick at the daycare the state paid to put the child in while the mother earned dignity.","en_US.blogs",4338

What I wrote was so true, so simple, that it connected me to my Lord. Feeling that connection was something I haven't felt for a long time, the connection you get when He lets you know He hasn't left you. The feeling I get when I'm at summer school was the same feeling I got through this poem - that 'high' feeling where you are totally in awe and in love with the Lord and you feel it back. I have to be honest, it's not something I feel all the time. It's not something you will feel all the time. Faith is a blind thing most of the time, but God does confirm it to time to time.

"14745","Queen Elizabeth I never married so there is no need to speculate about the footwear she would have chosen for the great day. However, there is a story that her shoes (colour unspecified, but let’s say ‘red’ for the sake of continuity) were saved from spoiling in a muddy puddle, by the gallant act of Sir Walter Raleigh (1554-1618), who removed his cloak and laid it in her path. This always struck me as a rather silly thing to do, and the story paints Raleigh as something of a show-off, overshadowing his success as a writer, poet, soldier, courtier, spy, gardener, historian, religious enquirer, MP and explorer. It was a grand gesture but it didn’t save him from the executioner’s axe many years later. By then, King James I was on the throne, and he was not one to be so easily swayed. The legendary act is commemorated on a pub sign in Devon. This should please Alan, who gave us the shoe prompt for this week’s Sepia Saturday, but is also an aficionado of pub signs, which he demonstrates on his own blog","en_US.blogs",4745

"14770","Oh, where to begin!? My sister, Miken, came to visit for the past 5 days and I have not even had a chance to catch my breath, let alone sit down and write about all the amazing things she we have been doing in the city. Of course, when people come to visit, I take them to all of my favorite places (which just happen to be the most amazing restaurants and parks in the city). After a tantalizing meal her first night at Graffiti, I decided to take her to a not-so-famous-in-the-Midwest-but-on-every-New York-corner chain, Pret a Manger, for lunch on Thursday. I essentially only put her through this “trying to be Panera restaurant” because I was at work and only had a few minutes to chow (and because the Panera on 5th Avenue does not open for another month – but they are looking for employees!!). During lunch, I quickly realized that she was making her way through the city quickly. In the few short hours of my Thursday morning, she had walked north through Time Square, visited the Museum of Modern Art and then walked back down 6th Avenue to make her way back to me (saying she was surprised she saw Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall within blocks of where I work is an understatement – and Miken, I forgot to tell you that Lady A performed there this weekend…oops!). She was then going to head east down 42nd Street to Grand Central, inevitably get lost inside, and then north on 5th Avenue so she could pass all of the “tourist shops” (meaning 10 H&M’s, 22 Forever 21’s, 3 Abercrombie’s, 6 American Eagles, and Tiffany’s). Well, perhaps that is an exaggeration on the store counts but that is my perception of 5th Avenue. By the time I saw her again after work, she had walked all the way to Central Park and saw a seal performance at the Central Park Zoo before making her way back to my apartment. Talk about a long first day in New York City. She saw pretty much all of what Midtown had to offer. And it was time to pick her up for Kickball (duh, Thursday)! We walked down to the Lower East Side with no doubt her whole body was going to ache in the morning. But it was a relaxing night, contrast with previous Thursdays. (We lost our game so not many were up to go out but more about that later.) We finally called it a night around 10:00 pm.","en_US.blogs",4770

Right now it is hard to say what the final product of The Avengers will be like. All we know is that this summer will be a box office showdown between Marvel’s Avengers and DC’s The Dark Knight Rises.

They do it from their hearts and without much expectation of anything in return. Oh, I know they have a “reputation” and their sexual exploits are well documented, but aside from that, there are other needs that they fulfill. Mostly, a good groupie doubles as a muse, providing inspiration and support, helping to keep these artists on track and give them much needed TLC. This business takes its toll.

I think by this he was implying that the prose was so good it drew you into Freddie's psychology, however horrible. Others, however, didn't feel that it did. John said that he was alienated by the self-consciously fine writing, the long passages without variety of tone, the sameness of the obsessive viewpoint without the relief of others. Jenny said she hadn't enjoyed reading it at all: it was made quite clear from the start that Freddie was a murderer and a horrible person, and there was no further development on that notion: all that the book was was an explication of that, and it wasn't an enjoyable experience.","en_US.blogs",4847

"14861","So, here we have it. The fruit of the spirit calls us to love as He loved. So, to put it another way, what would you feel for me if I saved your life? I saw a bus careening down the street that you were crossing. You had your head down, listening to your iPod as you walked out into traffic, and did not hear it approaching. Deftly, I rip you from the jaws of certain death, and make you feel the warm sensation of a second chance at life. You would revere me. You would want to talk to me, and be around me. You would spend the rest of your existence trying to make that up to me. Even after I told you that all that I wanted from you was a relationship with you, that all I wanted was for you to listen, pay attention at all times, and help someone else that may not have the same chances as you – you would feel like it was not enough. How could it be? I risked certain death, and may have even died myself, just from a want to give you a second chance to wake and breathe the next day. Well, God did that and more. Except instead of just rescuing one of us, He rescued us all. Forever, and ever He has saved generation after generation of peoples on this planet, just because He wants to enjoy our company more than anything else. God is not a solitary God; He is a God for all the ages, and He can be everything and nothing all at the same time. He has saved us all through love and He wants us to give nothing more back to Him than a portion of our time, a portion of our money, and a portion of our love. He says though, that if we do this, above all things he will bring us out of the dark and into the light. What is love? God shows us and has shown us what that feeling really is time and time again. He allowed us to get up this morning, and He allows us the opportunity to go to bed tonight whether we have a relationship with Him or not. Love is an ocean, and we are all sinking in it. But the key is to let go, and allow yourself to be overcome with the waters so that we rest securely in His love always. Once we have that figured out, we will see truly how His love can keep us alive. Praise Him for allowing me to see His plan, even if it is difficult to wrap my head around. He is greater, and I am lesser. His love sustains me, and His grace is sufficient enough to make me follow through in life. Praise Him for giving me so many chances. Praise Him for His perfect love that never lets me go. Praise Him for allowing me to see this fruit of the spirit that I have so much of, but also the need to apply it to many more facets of my life as well. Above all, praise Him for going to the cross on my behalf to show me the ultimate example of love. Thank you Lord.","en_US.blogs",4861

Trees and shrubs are completely dormant now, so the concept of transplant shock does not apply. However, you do need to treat any new plantings the same now as you would if it were the middle of summer. New plantings need to be thoroughly watered in regardless of the weather conditions. If it is below freezing but the ground is not frozen, go ahead and plant, taking care to backfill the hole with as loose a soil mix as you can. As soon as the temperatures are back, above freezing go back to your new plantings and water them in. If you have spring bulbs that you have not planted in the ground yet, you need to make that a priority. A little bone or blood meal placed over the planting areas will help keep the squirrels away from your bulbs. They are also great additives for your bulbs.","en_US.blogs",4880

It's a long story; let's just say that it had something to do with the vexed question of precisely how Christ could be both God and man. It was to the fifth century church what the argument over gay clergy is to the 21st: divisive, unresolveable and ultimately a bit daft. About twenty years ago a high-powered group of theologians came up with a form of words that seemed to satisfy everybody (except the few remaining Nestorians).

When you walk in the door to The Salt Lick you see kitchen off to the right and everyone buzzing around chopping and cutting some of the best looking BBQ I have seen outside of my own smoker. At the corner of the counter they have a few of their homemade pies sitting on display and I knew I would have to try one, but more about that later. The seating is picnic style with long tables and benches for everyone to sit together and enjoy. I can imagine that when it is busy this can be a little bit annoying as I don’t really care for sharing my table with complete strangers but luckily I did not have to worry about it since they were not very busy when I got there.","en_US.blogs",4949
