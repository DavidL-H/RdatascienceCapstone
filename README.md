# RdatascienceCapstone
Capstone project for the R data Science specialization on Coursera, by John Hopkins University  
https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-science-project  
  
In this project web-scaped text data was used to generate a predictive algorithm for input text. The requirements were that the model should be small, accurate and fast, suitable for deployment on e.g. a mobile device.  

The final product was a simple **Shiny app**, to show off the predictive model: https://davidlh.shinyapps.io/SwfitKeyPredCapstone/  
Additionall a **5-slide pitch deck** was made to superficially describe the project and resulting model: https://rpubs.com/Davidlh/DataScienceCapstone
